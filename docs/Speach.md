Good afternoon, everyone! 

We are team veterans!!! 

Today, we are here to present a solution to one of the most important problems faced by higher education institutions which is  timetable scheduling. So today we are here with calvio our app for timetable scheduling. 

Before we understand why calvio is best, let us understand why do we need calvio

Nep 
Which stands for national education policy was implemented on July 29 2020 and it brought a lot changes 
Some of the most important changes were 
Addition of subject earlier there used to be on 4 or 5 core subject but now it has been made compulsory for student to have 
Atleast 

1 skill subject 
1 minor 
And  

1 ability enhancement subject ! 
Making a total of 8 subject
As a result  there is a lot of unfair workload distribution among teachers, clashes of classes, and stress among students. 
That's the reason why higher education institutions will need our app


Now let us understand why calvio is best 

1 

In other available applications teachers have to manually type all the data which lead to alot of manual work and is not at all an efficient way. 

But in our web based application teacher can directly upload an Excel sheet , saving a lot of time ! 


2

All the other applications in market use only algorithm to make time table ! 

But our applications will use both LLM and algorithm to make timetable making it more user friendly

3 

other applications in market are quite expensive, for example, ASC it is software used by major universities to make timetables and it cost around 56000 rs annually! 

But our applications will be cost efficient ! 

And the key feature of our app will be ! 

Automatically managing adjustments!
Yes you heard it right our web based application will manage adjustment 
 Making teachers stress free !


Now I will explain how our application will work ! 

As soon as teacher uploads an Excel sheet Our web based application will use genetic algorithm to make timetable. If it takes more than 5 minute for an algorithm to make time table our LLM will come to rescue !

LLM will find constrains and report it to user . 

making it more easy for user to know the problem .

And now I will tell how our adjustment manager will work ! 

As soon as teacher leave is approved our rescheduling algorithm will start looking for teachers who are free during that particular period slot ! 

After checking all the available teacher it will first send request to subject teacher , if the subject teacher is not available, it will then automatically send request to all other faculty available at that period slot 

Once the teacher accepts the adjustment it will alter the timetable!
Talking about feasibility and viability 
Our idea of this timetable generator is not only innovative but highly feasible 
With the advancement in optimization algorithm, web technology and increasing digital adoption in almost every institutions and building , such system is very practical today 
Taking an example 
If the teacher is not available on Monday (she is on leave or absent)  the system will automatically resuffles the classes without disturbing the whole schedule


Now of course we do face CHALLENGES
EVERY System, every problem comess with the challenges
And ensuring data privacy, handling such a scheduling constraints and implementing a reliable algorithm will be our key concerns
For example 
If teacher A cannot take morning classes, Teacher B teaches only 2 sub and lab C is available only on wed 
These are complex but he optimization algorithm can solve them quickly

For the security, student and faculty data will be encrypted and only accessible to admins only
For reliability wr will be running test cases and Prediocally audit the AI engine to ensure balanced work load


Coming to impacts and benefits
See normally creating a timetable takes 1-2 days ot manual work and still can have errors
But with our system timetable can be created within minutes 
But if still two teachers are accidentally scheduled in same slot, system can detect it and prevent it automatically
This ensures classrooms and labs are used properly
And work load will be distributed fairly

This solution will bring efficiency , transparency and fairness in the academic
And teachers can focus on teaching and the system will manage  everything 


To conclude 
Our project will be designed to simplify scheduling, save valuable time and ensure error free timetable creation

We believe that this solution can greatly reduce workload for teachers while being scalable for the future

Thank you for your time and attention we would love to hear your feedback and questions
